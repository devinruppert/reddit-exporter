# reddit-exporter

A Python script that will export posts, comments, and scores for each for a specified month to a CSV. This data will then be used to score specific sentiments over time for actions to be taken at the company. Data will be re-analyzed on a rolling 3 month cadence to ensure findings are up-to-date with any data removals or deletions.
